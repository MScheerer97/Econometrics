# Econometrics Seminar 
This repository was created to provide the results of my seminar paper in the Econometrics class of my master's studies in Data Science in Business and Economics at the University of TÃ¼bingen in the winter semester 21/22. <br>
All data analysis was performed using the open-source language R. <br>

### About The Project

Almost 21 months have passed since the first Covid-19 Case was confirmed in Germany on the 27th January in Munich. 
To this date, various non-pharmaceutical interventions were imposed to contain the virus and keep people safe. <br>

Last year in December, a curfew was imposed forcing people to get home by 9pm, except for emergencies. However, the question whether these countermeasures are effective in reducing the number of daily cases or deaths needs to be addressed by a profound quantitative analysis. <br>

Hence, I perform a cross-country panel data analysis to dig deep into this intricate topic and to compare different NPIs with regards to their efficiency. <br>
